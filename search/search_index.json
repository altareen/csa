Course Location Course Title: AP Computer Science A Meeting Place: Room 308 Instructor: Mr. Alwin Tareen Course Website: https://altareen.github.io/csa GitHub Code Repository: https://github.com/altareen/csa Engage Grading Website: http://www.engage.com Course Description Introduction to the theory of computer science, and the craft of programming in Java . This course teaches students how to think algorithmically, and to solve problems efficiently. Topics include Java syntax, arithmetic expressions, text processing, object-oriented programming, arrays and ArrayLists , sorting algorithms, inheritance and recursion. Problem sets and labs are inspired by the real-world domains of biology, cryptography, finance, forensics, and gaming. This course is designed for both beginner and expert programmers alike. Reference Material Barron's AP Computer Science A, 8th Edition, Roselyn Teukolsky. This will be the primary textbook used in this course. The entire textbook will be provided to students free of charge. Blue Pelican Java, Version 7.0.1A, Charles E. Cook. This textbook contains additional material that will be useful in this course. It will be provided to students free of charge. Head First Java, 2nd Edition, K. Sierra and B. Bates. This textbook provides an in-depth study of the Java language. It is useful as a reference guide, but it won't be used in class. Hardware Each student is required to bring their laptop computer to class. Windows, Mac OS and Linux operating systems are supported. Homework Homework assignments will be posted regularly on the class website. Students are required to download and complete the assignment in electronic form. Homework submission instructions will be described within the assignment overview. Students are expected to submit their homework before the due date. Late Policy If a student submits their homework within 24 hours after the due date has passed, I will impose a 50% grading penalty . After that time frame, the homework will be assigned a grade of 0 . Plagiarism Copying all or part of a programming solution, from another student, or from an Internet source, is a violation of the BNDS Academic Dishonesty Policy. Any assignment that has been found to be plagiarized will receive a grade of 0 . Grading Homework: Students are encouraged to put forth their best effort, even if the result does not compile, or produces an incorrect output. Students will receive partial credit in such cases. Labs: Students will be expected to demonstrate their programming proficiency by working through coding problems in class. Quizzes: Short 15 minute quizzes on current topics. These will be announced in advance. Tests: An extensive test of the topics covered in the section. Tests will be graded with partial credit, and carefully analyzed for understanding and general knowledge. Tests will consist of problems similar to examples covered in class and homework.
