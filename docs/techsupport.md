# Technical Support

## What happens if the Mock Exam Webpage becomes unaccessable?
+ Check your email. As a failsafe measure, the Mock Exam has been distributed to all students as the following email attachments:

Description | File Size | File Name
----------- | --------- | ---------
The Mock Exam Questions, in `PDF` format | 94KB | `mockExamQuestions.pdf`
`Java` Source Code for the Mock Exam     | 19KB | `mockexamcode.zip`

## My BlueJ application has crashed, and won't reopen!
+ You may use another IDE if you have one available, such as IntelliJ, Eclipse or NetBeans.
However, don't waste your time downloading and installing them on short notice. You may also develop your `Java` programs using a simple text editor, such as Notepad++, Submlime, Vim, Emacs or Gedit.

## I can't access the Web-CAT autograder website!
+ If you can't seem to log in to Web-CAT, for whatever reason, then just send me your completed `Java` code responses as email attachments. I can view the timestamps on the email, to ensure that it was sent within the Mock Exam time limit.

## My computer has crashed, and refuses to boot up again!
+ Access the Mock Exam Website, or the Mock Exam email attachments, using your cell phone. Write your `Java` responses on a piece of paper, and use your phone to take a photo of them. Send the photos to me as email attachments. Only do this as an absolute last resort.

## Every piece of technology that I own(desktop/laptop/tablet/phone) has failed!
+ I will be monitoring my emails during the exam period.
+ Send me an email detailing the specific troubles that you have encountered, and I will assess the situation on a case-by-case basis.
